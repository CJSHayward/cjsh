# CJSH
An experimental shell based on Python. To run it, run:

$ git commit https://github.com/CJSHayward/cjsh.git
$ cjsh/cjsh

## Batteries Included

CJSH comes with full Python power. Indent by one or more tabs (four spaces are
considered a tab), and you are no longer issuing individual shell commands;
you're programming in Python.

Drop the initial tabs and a shell line will be included in your code, *with
variable interpolation*.

A blank line terminates the Python or mixed block.

Please note that programming your CJSH ~/.cjshrc file is unusually useful.
